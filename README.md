# Segment Tree

Segment Tree is an all-in-one interview preparation platform designed to help software engineers master System Design, CS Fundamentals, and more.

## 🚀 Features

### 🏗️ System Design (HLD) Workspace
- **Interactive Whiteboard**: Drag-and-drop architecture components (Load Balancers, Databases, Caches, etc.) to design scalable systems.
- **AI-Powered Feedback**: Get instant, detailed feedback on your designs from our AI mentor. It analyzes your architecture for scalability, reliability, and bottlenecks.
- **Curated Problems**: Practice with real-world scenarios like "Design Twitter", "Design Uber", and "Design a URL Shortener".
- **Requirements Checklist**: Keep track of functional and non-functional requirements while you design.

### 🧠 CS Fundamentals
- **Topic-wise Quizzes**: Test your knowledge in OS, DBMS, CN, and DSA.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Learn from every question with comprehensive answers.

### 📚 Structured Learning Paths
- **Guided Courses**: Step-by-step modules to cover essential engineering concepts.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your journey and pick up where you left off.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, React Flow (for the whiteboard)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- **AI**: Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) for design analysis
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth
